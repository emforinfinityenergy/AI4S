# AI4S Teen Cup Challenge
My repo for AI4S Teen Cup Challenge.

[Contest Page](https://bohrium.dp.tech/competitions/8524835166?tab=introduce)

**Files under folders**:
- `baseline.ipynb` The baseline file provided to contestants.
- `solution.py` My solution, in python.
- `submission.ipynb` My submission file, in jupiter notebook, since they only accept `.ipynb`, which sucks.
- `trail.py` Actually the `solution.py` for the physics problem
- `csv_gen.py` The data generator for testing the codes for the math problem.
- Other files are probably provided by the host of the contest.

 My Score:

| Score                 | Math     | Biology  | Physics  | Chemistry |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| A Score               | 0.7903/1 | 1.0000/1 | 0.8042/1 | 0.9897/1  |
| B Score (final score) | N/A      | N/A      | N/A      | *A Score* |

B Scores will be released when the contest **officially** ends (23:59, Feb. 28, 2025, UTC+8).

P.S.: The contest actually ends on Feb. 1, 2025, since **they(host of the contest) have released official solutions**, but it will not officially end until Feb. 28.
